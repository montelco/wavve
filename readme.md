# Wavvve: An ATMT Application

[![StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/60111658/shield)](https://styleci.io/repos/60111658)

The Wavvve application is still in testing and some code may not be structured by best practice simply out of convenience. Please excuse the mess while it's being cleaned up.

Wavvve is an online application meant for businesses to create and manage their virtual coupons (passes) that get distributed via Bluetooth beacons broadcasting a web URL via a JSON API endpoint. The Wavvve console allows the business to create a beautiful looking pass on any device and when they are ready they can publish it to their beacons from anywhere in the world. Wavvve works on a standard stack of MySQL for relational pass data, Laravel PHP for a simple, readable, and highly extensible language, and Vue.JS for SPA-ifying much of the application.
